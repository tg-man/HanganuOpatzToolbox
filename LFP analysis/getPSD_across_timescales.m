% from Mattia 06.20
% compute power spectra:
% 1. down to very low frequencies using multitapers of different length, 
% adjusting it to freq range and averaging over windows
% 2 & 3, without averaging over windows but with single window length.
% These are nice because you have a direct way to look at how power changes
% over time (since all the windows have the same length).
% IMPORTANT: for 2 & 3, for most applications it is better to take the
%            median instead of the mean across windows. It might seem
%            trivial, but it often has important effects. See for instance
%            "Measuring the average power of neural oscillations" 
%            (Izhikevich et al., 2018).

% input:    - LFP: channels x time
%                  keep the sampling rate low to save time!
%           - fs: sampling rate of LFP signal
%           - freq2analyze: frequencies to analyze (generally log spaced)
%                           ex: logspace(-2, log10(50), 20). these are the
%                           ones for multi-taper analysis
%           - slow_freqs: single window power, for slow frequencies
%           - fast_freqs: single window power, for fast frequencies
%           - folder2save: where to save stuff
%           - animal_name: string, for name of saved file
%           - area: string, brain area analyzed, for name of saved file
%           - save_data: 1=true, 0=false
% output:   - PSDstruct with the following fields: 
%               - PSD: multitaper PSD (channels * freqs)
%               - PSD_fast: single window PSD (window * freqs * channels)
%               - PSD_slow: single window PSD (window * freqs * channels)
%               - freqs: freqs relative to PSD
%               - freqs_fast: freqs relative to PSD_fast
%               - freqs_slow: freqs relative to PSD_slow
%               - time_fast: time at which windows of PSD_fast occurred
%               - time_slow: time at which windows of PSD_slow occurred
